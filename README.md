# Google × Kaggle AI Agents Intensive (Nov 10–14, 2025)

This repository contains materials and notes from the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive** conducted by **Google ML Research** and **Kaggle**.  
The program focuses on the design, orchestration, and evaluation of AI agents capable of reasoning, acting, and collaborating autonomously.

## 🧩 Overview

**Day 1 – Introduction to Agents**  
Explores the foundational concepts of agentic systems, including:
- The *Brain–Hands–Nervous System* analogy for model reasoning, tool execution, and orchestration.
- A five-stage agentic workflow: *Mission → Scan the Scene → Think → Act → Observe & Iterate*.
- The taxonomy of agents from Level 0 (core reasoning) to Level 4 (self-evolving systems).

**Hands-On Labs**
- **1a – From Prompt to Action:** Building a Gemini-powered agent with the Agent Development Kit (ADK).  
- **1b – Agent Architectures:** Implementing multi-agent workflows using sequential, parallel, and loop orchestration patterns.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Gemini / ADK (Agent Development Kit)**
