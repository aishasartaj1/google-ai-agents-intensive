# Google × Kaggle AI Agents Intensive (Nov 10–14, 2025)

This repository documents my progress through the **5-Day Google × Kaggle AI Agents Intensive**, a hands-on learning program focused on building intelligent, autonomous systems that can plan, reason, and act through structured orchestration and tool integration.

---

## 🧭 Program Focus

The intensive explores the complete lifecycle of agentic AI systems:
- **Design** – understanding agent architectures, reasoning frameworks, and taxonomy.  
- **Interoperability** – connecting agents to external tools and APIs using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).  
- **Memory & Context** – enabling agents to retain context and reason across multi-turn interactions.  
- **Quality** – improving reliability, observability, and evaluation through measurable metrics.  
- **Deployment** – scaling and connecting multi-agent systems using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) framework.

## 🧩 Day 1 – Key Learnings

- **Agentic Architectures** – Explored orchestration layers, function calling, and memory systems that enable agents to coordinate reasoning and action.  
- **ReAct Framework** – Implemented the *Reasoning + Acting* loop, where agents iteratively think, act, and observe.  
- **Function Calling with Gemini API** – Created agents that dynamically trigger real-world actions and API calls.  
- **Agent Design Patterns** – Practiced **Sequential**, **Parallel**, and **Loop** orchestration for multi-step workflows.  
- **ADK (Agent Development Kit)** – Used Gemini + ADK to design a multi-agent system and experiment with collaboration between specialized agents.
